# AuthorizationWeb
It's a study project to learn how built-in authorization in ASP.NET Core works. 
The project contains authorization service (new users registration, log-in with login & password, giving a JWT token to user) and 
a mock service which is accessible for authirized users with valid tokens only.
SQLite is used via Entity Framework.
Security key is placed in code just to simplify.
